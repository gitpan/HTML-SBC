books, blogs, wikis, boards and various other web applications. It produces
valid and semantic (X)HTML from input and is patterned on that tiny usenet
markups like *bold* and _underline_.

HTML::SBC tries to give useful error messages and guess the right translation
even with invalid input. It will always produce valid (X)HTML.

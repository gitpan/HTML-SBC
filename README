HTML::SBC

Simple blog code (SBC) is a simple markup language, You can use it for guest
books, blogs, wikis, boards and various other web applications. It produces
valid and semantic (X)HTML from input and is patterned on that tiny usenet
markups like *bold* and _underline_.

HTML::SBC tries to give useful error messages and guess the right translation
even with invalid input. It will always produce valid (X)HTML.
